- # Supercar Elite - Backend

This is the backend for the Supercar Elite web application. It is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## How it works

- The backend connects to MongoDB using Mongoose.
- It provides APIs for:
  - User authentication (register and login)
  - Booking cars (create, view, and delete bookings)
  - Contact us (Contact us form)
- It allows requests from the frontend using CORS.
- Data is sent and received in JSON format.
